# Titanic Kaggle Project for CS6665: Data Mining

This project is one famous project in Kaggle. We approched it from two different perspectives: Machine Learning and Deep Learning. This project developed using the Kaggle kernels. So, the best platform to test the code is Kaggle Kernels. We explained how the code can be run on Kaggle step by step:

1 - Since the code will be run under tha Kaggle, it is required to have a Kaggle account. If you do not have a Kaggle account, you can sign-up by following this link: https://www.kaggle.com/account/login?phase=startRegisterTab&returnUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kaggle.com%2F

2 - Once you log-in into Kaggle, you need to search "Titanic" to find the competition. The competition is listed as "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster" in Kaggle. If you cannot find the competition, you can use the following link to reach the competition page: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic

3 - Once you are in the competition webpage, you can just click on "Join Competition" using the button[Blue background and white foreground colored].

4 - After you join the competition, go to the "Notebooks" section and create a new codebook again by clicking the button[Blue background and white foreground colored]. Here is the link to reach notebooks section in case cannot find. https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks

5 - While you are creating the codebook, leave everything as default and just click to "Create". Kaggle will create a kernel for you. You may change the Kernel name in case you wish to reach that later easily.

6 - Once you create the Kernel, Kaggle is automatically place the necessary files[Train.csv, Test.csv, Gender_Submission.csv] files to the correct locations.

7 - You can copy the python code that is given in "project_code.py" file. 

8 - After pasting the code to the Kernel, you can click play on kernel to compile & run the project.

9 - You should see the following output on Kaggle Console.

"Packages are loaded...
Program is started to running...
Reading titanic data files[train.csv, test.csv, gender.submission.csv]...
Files are loaded successfully[train.csv, test.csv, gender.submission.csv]...

Output file has been saved as: submission.csv"

THANK YOU for reading.
