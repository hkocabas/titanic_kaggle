# titanic_kaggle
This project is one famous project in Kaggle. We approched it from two different perspectives: Machine Learning and Deep Learning. This project developed using the Kaggle kernels. So, the best platform to test the code is Kaggle Kernels. We explained how the code can be run on Kaggle step by step:

1 - Since the code will be run under tha Kaggle, it is required to have a Kaggle account. If you do not have a Kaggle account, you can sign-up by following this link: https://www.kaggle.com/account/login?phase=startRegisterTab&returnUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kaggle.com%2F
2 - Once you log-in into Kaggle, you need to search "Titanic" to find the competition. The competition is listed as "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster" in Kaggle. If you cannot find the competition, you can use the following link to reach the competition page: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic
3 - Once you are in the competition webpage, you can just click on "Join Competition" using the button[Blue background and white foreground colored].
